This repository contains a Java project for a Bus Reservation System, developed using JDBC connectivity, Java GUI, and data structures. The system allows users to book bus tickets, view available buses, manage bookings, and perform various administrative tasks related to bus operations.

Features
User-friendly GUI: The system provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
Database Connectivity: Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for seamless interaction with a backend database, enabling storage and retrieval of bus schedules, user information, and bookings.
Bus Booking: Users can search for available buses, select seats, and book tickets for desired routes and dates.
Administrative Functions: Admins can manage bus schedules, add new buses, view booking details, and perform other administrative tasks through the system.
Data Structure Implementation: Efficient data structures are employed to manage bus routes, seat availability, and user bookings.
Technologies Used
Java: The project is developed entirely in Java programming language.
Swing GUI: Java Swing is used for building the graphical user interface.
JDBC: JDBC is employed for database connectivity, allowing interaction with a MySQL database.
Data Structures: Data structures such as arrays, lists, and maps are utilized for efficient data management.
Getting Started
To run the Bus Reservation System locally:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up a MySQL database and import the provided schema (bus_reservation_system.sql).
Configure the database connection details in the Java code (DatabaseManager.java).
Compile and run the Java application (BusBookingUI.java).
Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest new features to enhance the Bus Reservation System.
